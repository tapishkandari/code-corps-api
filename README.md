---

This is the [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/) and [Phoenix](http://www.phoenixframework.org/) backend API for [codecorps.org](https://www.codecorps.org).

Code Corps is an open source platform for building and funding public software with massive social impact.

Our goals:

- **Connect people** - Match developers and designers, project managers and marketers – any and every talent – to ambitious projects that need their help.
- **Provide support** - Educate and train, develop and encourage people who build public software. Help projects be successful and people to do their best work.
- **Fund projects** - Crowdfund ongoing work and keep funders engaged in projects and connected to the teams they're supporting.
- **Develop new tools** - Help people collaborate on, organize, and even distribute their work. Listen closely to hear what needs built, and then build it.

## How can I help?

We'd love to have you contribute to Code Corps directly!

- First, read the guidelines in our [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/code-corps/code-corps-api/blob/develop/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).
- Then [look at our current projects](https://github.com/code-corps/code-corps-ember/projects?query=sort%3Acreated-asc) to find something that interests you.

Have questions? Need help? You can also always come :wave: hello [in our Slack](http://slack.codecorps.org), where there are always a ton of us around to help you learn, debug, or just shoot the breeze.

We highlight everyone who's contributed to [the Code Corps team page](https://www.codecorps.org/team). If we've missed you for some reason, please [open an issue in the Ember app](https://github.com/code-corps/code-corps-ember/issues/new)!

## Where should I help?

We recommend checking the latest [milestones on GitHub](https://github.com/code-corps/code-corps-api/milestones) to get a sense for our current priorities.

Of course, help with other areas is always welcome, so if the current milestones aren't your cup of tea, feel free to [browse the issues](https://github.com/code-corps/code-corps-api/issues).

And you can _always_ ask us for advice on where to start [in our Slack](http://slack.codecorps.org).

We care about:

- Each other :raised_hands:
